## Books

* The introduction to algorithms
* For programmers Who don't know how to Datastructure and would like to do other things well too

## Time and space complexity

[Time and space complexity](https://theprimeagen.github.io/fem-algos/lessons/algorithms-and-time-space-complexity/time-and-space-complexity)

### Concepts
* Growth is with the respect of input
* Constants are dropped
* Worst case is usually the way we measure

## Arrays Data Structure

Continuous space of the type of data. 

With an array we have to specify the size of space we allocated  UInt8 and UInt16 are completly different

a = int[3] -> a[0] access first space

Array specificity Access, modify and delete a specific index. Array can't grow

## Search

### Linear search & kata setup
