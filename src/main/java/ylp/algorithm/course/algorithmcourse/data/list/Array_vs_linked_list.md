# Array vs linked list

## Usability

Array -> need to know how many item in advance

Linked list -> user friendly

## complexity
Array -> everything is o(1)

Linked list -> depend

## Memory
Array -> Allocated at construction

Linked list -> when needed (but pointer chasing, wrapper, non continuous)
