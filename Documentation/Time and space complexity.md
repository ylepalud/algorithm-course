## Time and space complexity

[Time and space complexity](https://theprimeagen.github.io/fem-algos/lessons/algorithms-and-time-space-complexity/time-and-space-complexity)

### Concepts
* Growth is with the respect of input
* Constants are dropped
* Worst case is usually the way we measure

### Tricks
If you have input at every step complexity is log(n) or nlog(n)
